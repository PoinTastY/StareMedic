> This is the second attempt uploading it properly, i've tried it once and worked in there but it was trash so now is in a private archive, here we are doing good rn.

This SW began with the request from a hospital in my hometown where they have a program older than me, so I decided to make one updated as a challenge for me and once i'm satisfacted with the result, i'll offer it to the hospital.

## What does it has?
> It is pretty simple, but i hope to improve it each time, even if it is not accepted

Starting from the bottom, it has a database runing in postgres, bcs that is the one that im familiarized with, and also I neded to create one for a school project, so here it is. Then is the db context running with entity framework and Npsql.
Then i have a repositorie wich i use to comunicate the code-behind with the db, that basically just add functions to the db context list-like objects.
Finally, the MAUI mess, I rlly like this framework, and i do my best to keep the solution with a good shape, trying to follow the best practicies, and not to do a horrible UI.


I'm kinda proud of my progress, and also with the fact that every step i take, sometimes i go back to fix something that i made for it just to work, so lets keep up.
